Hi there! My name is Carol Santos, I'm a Brazilian 🇧🇷 Front-End Developer living in São Paulo. Front-End development has been a huge passion for me as I've started studying it when I was 13 years old, and I've been working professionally since 2013. Currently I make Front-End magic at [Alura](https://alura.com.br), a learning platform specialized in tech. My hobbies include coding 💻, video-games 🎮, gardening 🌱, caring for my pup 🐶, making candles 🕯️ and illustrating 🎨.
